This is using a neural network(Brain.js) to try to determine an NBA player's averages against a certain defense.

Right now the only input it uses is defensive rating. I plan to add many more variables to this to try and get a more realistic prediction.

This works by taking a player's averages for the year, and compares that to the defensive rating of the opponent.
